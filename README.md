# CIFAR-10-ResNet-Global-Optima

Welcome to the Mini-project repository for the Global Optima group. This project focuses on optimizing and modifying the ResNet architecture to achieve the highest possible accuracy on the CIFAR-10 image classification dataset while maintaining a model size of no more than 5 million parameters.

## Project Deliverables

### `results/`
This directory contains all the key components of our project:
- **`Report.pdf`**: Our comprehensive project report detailing the methodologies, experiment results, and conclusions.
- **`resnet_5M.ipynb`**: The Jupyter notebook for our final ResNet model with 5 million parameters.
- **`predictions.csv`**: The predictions file that was used for the Kaggle competition submission.
- **`ckpt.pth`**: The checkpoint file containing the trained model weights.
- **`training_validation_plot.png`**: Visual representation of training and validation accuracy and loss over the epochs.

### `Experiments/`
Contains Jupyter notebooks for various configurations and experimental setups tested during the development phase of the project.

## Getting Started

To get started with exploring and running the project:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/tanmayr71/CIFAR-10-ResNet-Global-Optima.git
